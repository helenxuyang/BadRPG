# BadRPG
AOOD pair project (worked with partner) - RPG style game affectionately called BadRPG

Our final project for Advanced Object Oriented Design was an open-ended project to create a professional-quality video game with a partner. Although my partner and I knew that we wanted to create an RPG-style game, we also recognized that realistically, as two high schoolers with a month and a half to create a fully fledged game in Java, it wasn’t going to be the most amazing thing out there. Thus, “BadRPG” was born: a sort of a parody of an RPG game, with a pun-filled storyline and basic pixel graphics.

I designed the sprites and inventory interface, and coded most aspects of the quests including picking up collectable items, equipping items, the NPC dialogue system, and keeping track of current and completed quests. My partner focused on world generation, character movement, and random item spawning.
